# ModexAgent

Multi-agent framework where a main agent coordinates subagents through a star-topology pool, with multi-live workspace isolation.

## Language

**Pool**:
A group of agents coordinated through a main agent in star topology. The main agent dispatches to subagents via communication tools; subagents respond through the bus. There is exactly one pool per configuration unit (`PoolConfig`).
_Avoid_: cluster, fleet, swarm, group

**Pool Instance**:
Deployment-scoped runtime resources for one pool — providers, tool managers, skill managers, broker bridge, communication service. Not per-turn data; lives for the pool's lifetime.
_Avoid_: pool container, pool context

**Workspace**:
An isolated execution context that owns its own pools and per-pool data (memory, runtime stores, experience). Multiple workspaces can coexist (multi-live), each addressable via `/cd`.
_Avoid_: environment, sandbox, session space

**Assembly**:
The process of constructing runtime objects (pools, workspace stacks, communication infrastructure) from configuration (`AppConfig` / `PoolConfig`). Pool mode is the only assembly mode.
_Avoid_: initialization, bootstrapping, wiring (use "assembly" for the process, "wiring" for specific connections)

**Main Agent**:
The entry-point agent in a pool that receives user input, dispatches to subagents, and produces final output. Identified by `main_agent_name` in `PoolConfig`.
_Avoid_: primary agent, root agent, orchestrator
